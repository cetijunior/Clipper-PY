0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
But just for... is it rolling?

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Nah, so...

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Where are we?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Point to a beauty parlor.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have all these beauty parlor for men.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Alright, so...

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You see the beauty parlor?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They're very gay.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Who use... I don't need... I don't need no fucking beauty parlor.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Or I need water and salt.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is really...

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You know, if you think part of this is it, it is pretty...

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No?

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm talking with you, but I'm not with the camera.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, indeed.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, for me...

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Where is all you was not?

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
For all I was...

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To...

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Right, right, right.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is absolutely fucking fair.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Absolutely.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Do not drink anything colorful.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What about this one?

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's different.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's different.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's normal.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's normal.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, comfortable.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No smell, smell, it's...

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is definitely just a little bit gay.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You know why?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Because I love oranges, but real, like natural oranges.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You know?

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And fabricated oranges is absolutely very gay.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You make it yourself, you know?

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Orndroes, but natural, or bringing oranges, like your grandma can just squeeze the...

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Like to make lemonade, yeah.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Like, so many other things.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But this is gay.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I like what they do.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Not for all me.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, sorry.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So, anything, if you want to drink fucking alcohol,

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
do not go for alcohol-free drinks.

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Like, what's the point?

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why do you drink beer if there's no alcohol inside?

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like, just please.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you drink beer without a...

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I drink beer straight out the cake.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There you go, you're not gay.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Fucking hell, look at this.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Anyway, I'll know if there's alcohol-free, but...

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Alcohol-free.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You just really say something.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's so hard.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So, snacks.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
When we talk about snacks, you need to only eat fruits.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right?

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
None of these are applicable in your case.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Just, you don't be strong, like, less hard drive food.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Drive food?

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I guess it's tolerable.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No?

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, it's okay.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But, fucking, look.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's nice.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Every cancer is.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now, we don't discriminate food, right?

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We love food, but...

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We're not eating the cancer food.
